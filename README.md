# skins.tkte.ch

skins.tkte.ch was the first Minecraft skin site, starting way back in...2010?
2009? Can't even remember. Eventually, it became minecraftskins.com, which was
then sold and became an ad-infested abomination. My bad.

This repository is generated from the last skins.tkte.ch datadump. Its goal is
to fix the tens of thousands of links that still exist to skins.tkte.ch and
save a tiny piece of history.

Currently, there is no plan to make it anything other than this read-only
archive. Feel free to take the index and build your own site.
