<h1>skins.tkte.ch</h1>

<p>This is a historical archive of <em>{{ site.posts|size }}</em> minecraft
  skins posted on skins.tkte.ch.</p>
<p>skins.tkte.ch was the first Minecraft skin site, starting way back
  in...2010?  2009? Can't even remember. Eventually, it became
  minecraftskins.com, which was then sold and became an ad-infested
  abomination. My bad.</p>
<p>This repository is generated from the last skins.tkte.ch datadump. Its goal
  is to fix the tens of thousands of links that still exist to skins.tkte.ch
  and save a tiny piece of history.</p>
